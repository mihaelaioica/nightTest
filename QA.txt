1. How would you test an ATM? What functions of the ATM would you check, and from what perspectives?

Here is a web link that is describing the verifies that should be performed for an ATM:  https://artoftesting.com/atm 

- Verify the type of ATM machine
-verify the pin number is correct, 
-verify the card is valid, 
-verify to not display any information until the user is not entering the correct pin number etc


2. How would you test inputs containing: 

                   a. Strings 

Test the unhappy path:
- get and set invalid string values to inputs that contains strings by using special characters eg quotes etc
- test long strings that exceds the maxium size of the input
- make other validations according to the test application 

Test the happy path:
- get and set valid string values to the input 
- validate the maximum size of the input string
- validate that the string contains only letters , letters and numbers, any other special characters that can not break the test
- test more cases according to the test application

                   b. Paths/Files 

Test the happy path:
-validate that local file exists 
-validate path to exist
-verify the path is entered correct in the input 
-make any other validations according to the application: file extensions, file sizes etc

Test the unhappy path:
-test the input by entering also invalid paths or files that doesn't exist 
-test with big file size 
-test with wrong file extensions 

other examples how you can upload and download a file using the web browser:

                   c. Time and Date

here are four ways of instantiating a date in javascript:
var d = new Date();
var d = new Date(milliseconds);
var d = new Date(dateString);
var d = new Date(year, month, day, hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds);

test the happy path:
- convert date to string to a certain date format using the date object methods like toLocaleString(), toISOString() etc (date methods : https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_date.asp)
- test valid format dates and compare, verify dates like strings

test the unhappy path:
- test invalid format dates (eg year to contain 5 digits, month 3 digits etc)
